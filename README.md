# AI-Powered-3D-Mesh-Creator
3D Mesh Creator is a web-based software tool designed to help users visualize, edit, and export 3D mesh models using raw mesh data â€” specifically vertex coordinates and face indices. Unlike traditional tools that require 3D model files or image-based reconstruction, this platform focuses on directly transforming structured geometric.
